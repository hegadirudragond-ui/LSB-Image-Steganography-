# LSB-Image-Steganography-
Implemented LSB Image Steganography in C to securely hide and retrieve messages within BMP images. Utilized bitwise operations for encoding/decoding in the least significant bits, optimized memory usage, handled edge cases, and applied modular design, demonstrating strong C programming, low-level data manipulation, and problem-solving skills.
